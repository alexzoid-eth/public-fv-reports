## About Blend Protocol

Blend is a decentralized lending protocol built on Stellar's Soroban smart contract platform. It creates immutable, permissionless lending markets to increase trading and payment liquidity in the Stellar ecosystem while improving capital productivity. The protocol features isolated lending pools with mandatory insurance, reactive interest rate mechanisms, and permissionless pool creation, all within a non-custodial and censorship-resistant architecture.

## About the Backstop Module

The backstop module is a critical risk management component that protects lending pools from bad debt by providing first-loss capital. When a user's position isn't liquidated quickly enough, their bad debt is transferred to the backstop module. Users deposit BLND:USDC 80:20 liquidity pool shares and receive a percentage of interest paid by pool borrowers based on the pool's "Backstop Take Rate". While backstoppers can earn additional BLND emissions in the "reward zone", they assume first-loss risk - if a pool incurs bad debt, backstop deposits will be auctioned to cover losses proportionally. Withdrawals require a 21-day queue period, and earned interest and emissions are automatically reinvested.

## Competition Scope

For this formal verification competition, only the following files from the backstop module are in scope:

## Formal Verification Methodology

Certora Formal Verification (FV) provides mathematical proofs of smart contract correctness by verifying code against a formal specification. It complements techniques like testing and fuzzing, which can only sometimes detect bugs based on predefined properties. In contrast, Certora FV examines all possible states and execution paths in a contract.

Simply put, the formal verification process involves crafting properties (similar to writing tests) in native RUST language and submitting them alongside compiled programs to a remote prover. This prover essentially transforms the program bytecode and rules into a mathematical model and determines the validity of rules.

### Types of Properties

When constructing properties in formal verification, we mainly deal with two types: **Invariants** and **Rules**. Invariants are implemented in parametric style (one property for each external function) with `parametric_rule!()` macros. 

The structure of parametric rule:
- Initialize ghost storage from rule parameters (this a hack to reduce complexity of storage infractions)
- Assume realistic timestamp
- Assume valid state invariants hold
- Log all storage variables
- Execute external function
- Log all storage variables again

#### Invariants
- Conditions that MUST **always remain true** throughout the contract's lifecycle. Implemented with `invariant_rule!()`. Similar to parametric rules, but check the property hold with `cvlr_assert!()` macros. 
- Process:
  1. Define an initial condition for the contract's state.
  2. Execute an external function.
  3. Confirm the invariant still holds after execution.
- Example: "The total shares MUST always equal the sum of all user shares."
- Use Case: Ensures **Valid State** properties - critical state constraints that MUST never be violated.
- Feature: Proven invariants can be reused in other properties.

#### Rules
- Flexible checks for specific behaviors or conditions.
- Structure:
  1. Setup: Set valid state assumptions (e.g., "user balance is non-zero") with `init_verification!()` macros.
  2. Execution: Simulate contract behavior by calling external functions.
  3. Verification:
     - Use `cvlr_assert!()` to check if a condition is **always true** (e.g., "balance never goes negative").
     - Use `cvlr_satisfy!()` to verify a condition is **reachable** (e.g., "a user can withdraw funds").
- Example: "A withdrawal decreases the user's balance."
- Use Case: Verifies a broad range of properties, from simple state changes to complex business logic.

### Verification Process
The process is divided into two stages: **Setup** and **Crafting Properties**.

#### Setup
This stage prepares the contract and prover for verification. Use conditional source code compilation with `just features`.
- Resolve external contract calls, declare mocks in `mocks` and `summaries` directory (with `certora_token_mock`, `certora_pool_factory_mock` and `certora_emission_summarized` features)
- Simplify complex operations (mirroring storage r/w operations into ghosts variables with `certora_storage_ghost` feature, vector interactions with `certora_vec_q4w`) to reduce timeouts.
- Prove **Valid State properties** (invariants) as a foundation for further checks.

#### Crafting Properties
This stage defines and implements the properties:
- Write properties in **plain English** for clarity.
- Categorize properties by purpose (e.g., Valid State, Variable Transition). Some of them are implemented in parametric style (`valid_state.rs`, `state_trans.rs`, `sanity.rs`, `isolation.rs`), while others (`integrity_*.rs`, `high_level.rs`) as regular rules. 
- Use proven valid state invariants as assumptions in **Rules** for efficiency.

### Assumptions

Assumptions simplify the verification process and are classified as **Safe** or **Unsafe**. Safe assumptions are backed by valid state invariants or required by the environment. Unsafe made to reduce complexity, potentially limiting coverage.

#### Safe Assumptions

##### Timestamp Constraints
- Block timestamps are always non-zero (`e.ledger().timestamp() > 0`)

##### Valid State Invariants
These invariants are proven to always hold and can be safely assumed:

**Non-negative Value Invariants:**
- `valid_state_nonnegative_pb_shares`: Pool balance shares are non-negative
- `valid_state_nonnegative_pb_tokens`: Pool balance tokens are non-negative
- `valid_state_nonnegative_pb_q4w`: Pool balance Q4W amounts are non-negative
- `valid_state_nonnegative_ub_shares`: User balance shares are non-negative
- `valid_state_nonnegative_ub_q4w_amount`: User Q4W entry amounts are non-negative

**Pool Balance Invariants:**
- `valid_state_pb_q4w_leq_shares`: Pool Q4W total does not exceed pool shares

**User Balance Invariants:**
- `valid_state_ub_shares_plus_q4w_sum_eq_pb_shares`: User shares + Q4W amounts equal pool shares
- `valid_state_ub_q4w_sum_eq_pb_q4w`: Sum of user Q4W amounts equals pool Q4W total
- `valid_state_ub_q4w_expiration`: Q4W entry expiration times do not exceed timestamp + Q4W_LOCK_TIME
- `valid_state_ub_q4w_exp_implies_amount`: Q4W entries with expiration have non-zero amounts

**General State Invariants:**
- `valid_state_user_not_pool`: User addresses cannot be pool or contract addresses (zero balance enforced)
- `valid_state_pool_from_factory`: Only factory-deployed pools can have non-zero balances

#### Unsafe Assumptions

##### Mocks and Summaries
- Token contracts mocked with `certora_token_mock` feature
- Pool factory mocked with `certora_pool_factory_mock` feature
- Emission calculations summarized with `certora_emission_summarized` feature

##### Loop Unrolling
- Vector iterations limited to 2 iterations (`loop_iter = 2` in configs)

## Verification Properties

The verification properties are categorized into the following types:

1. **Valid State (VS)**: System state invariants that MUST always hold
2. **State Transitions (ST)**: Rules governing state changes during operations
3. **Isolation (ISO)**: Properties verifying operation independence and non-interference
4. **Sanity (SA)**: Basic reachability and functionality checks
5. **High Level (HL)**: Complex business logic and protocol-specific rules
6. **Integrity (INT)**: Properties ensuring data consistency and correctness

Each job status linked to a corresponding run in the dashboard with a specific status:

- ✅ completed successfully
- ⚠️ reached global timeout
- ❌ violated

### Valid State

The states define the possible values that the system's variables can take. These invariants ensure the backstop contract maintains consistency at all times.

All valid state properties are stored in [valid_state.rs](src/certora_specs/valid_state.rs) and [✅ passed verification](https://prover.certora.com/output/52567/6ffa5eabbcf1410984f2a3980a1943b8/?anonymousKey=c19763b34bc4e6a70e8035ce422c1953b3c0aeb6) successfully.

## Real Bug Finding

### Zero-amount Withdrawal Queue Entry

**Finding description and impact:**

The [execute_queue_withdrawal](https://github.com/code-423n4/2025-02-blend/blob/main/blend-contracts-v2/backstop/src/backstop/withdrawal.rs#L7-L29) function allows users to queue zero-amount entries for withdrawal, they provide no actual withdrawal value and consume limited queue slots (`MAX_Q4W_SIZE = 20`). This can lead to additional transaction overhead to dequeue zero entries one by one and a misleading queue state.

**Proof of Concept:**

This behavior [violates](https://prover.certora.com/output/52567/86ba83df36b94d6fb1d4f5cba794e4db/?anonymousKey=444a3ccf615f593ef927bf50aaf7b13ed5531a66) the formal verification invariant `valid_state_ub_q4w_exp_implies_amount`, which specifies that `Q4W` entries with non-zero expiration times always should have non-zero amounts.

```rust
// If a Q4W entry has a non-zero expiration time, it must have a non-zero amount
pub fn valid_state_ub_q4w_exp_implies_amount(
    e: Env,
    pool: Address,
    user: Address
) -> bool {
    let ub: UserBalance = storage::get_user_balance(&e, &pool, &user);

    if ub.q4w.len() != 0 {
        let entry0 = ub.q4w.get(0).unwrap_optimized();
        // If expiration is set (non-zero), amount must also be set (non-zero)
        if entry0.exp > 0 && entry0.amount == 0 {
            return false;
        }
    } 

    true
}
```
